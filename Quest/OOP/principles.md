##  Encapsulation

The combination of:
*   a mechanism through which objects restrict access to their components
*   a mechanism which bundles data with methods operating on that data

##  Inheritance

Is the creation of a class based on another class thus creating a class hierarchy

##  Polymorphism

Same interface - many forms.

### Ad-hoc polymorphism
When a function denotes different implementations depending on a limited range of types - function overloading

### Parametric polymorphism
When code does not depend on a specific type and thus can be used transparently with different types - generics

### Subtyping
When a name denotes several related classes related through a common superclass.
