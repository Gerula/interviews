# Given a string which only contains lowercase.
# You need delete the repeated letters only leave one, and try to make the lexicographical order of new string  is smallest.
# i.e:
# bcabc
# You need delete 1 &#39;b&#39; and 1 &#39;c&#39;, so you delete the first &#39;b&#39; and first &#39;c&#39;, the new string will be abc which is smallest.
# ps: If you try to use greedy algorithm to solve this problem, you must sure that you could pass this case:
# cbacdcbc. answer is  acdb not adcb
# I can&#39;t solve this problem well and the interviewer said that you can scan the string twice. First scan is do some preprocess, and the second is to get the answer, but I really can&#39;t come up this idea.
