# Given a string which only contains lowercase. You need delete the repeated letters only leave one, and try to make the lexicographical order of new string is smallest. 
# i.e: 
# bcabc 
# You need delete 1 'b' and 1 'c', so you delete the first 'b' and first 'c', the new string will be abc which is smallest. 
# PS: If you try to use greedy algorithm to solve this problem, you must make sure that you could pass this case: â€‹
# cbacdcbc. answer is acdb not adcb.
