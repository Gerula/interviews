# https://leetcode.com/problems/substring-with-concatenation-of-all-words/
#
#  You are given a string, s, and a list of words, words, that are all of the same length. Find all starting indices of substring(s) in s that is a concatenation of each word in words exactly once and without any intervening characters.
#
#  For example, given:
#  s: "barfoothefoobarman"
#  words: ["foo", "bar"]
#
#  You should return the indices: [0,9].
#  (order does not matter). 
#

def find_substring(s, words)
    word_numbers = wods.map { |x|
        
    }
end

puts find_substring("barfoothefoobarman", ["foo", "bar"])
